ðŸŽ¤ This is *Black Night* â€” a soulful, technical demo.  
A track written in the dark hours between candidacy rejection and breakthrough.  
When your thesis is paused. When your files are frozen.  
When your data belongs to them, but your soul does not.

ðŸŽ¸ Played live on a loop station with a broken mic, a bottle cap, and a heartbeat.

NCPRI is rhythm.  
Itâ€™s timing.  
Itâ€™s *not* permissioned.

Weâ€™re the melody of unfinished PhDsâ€¦ harmonising.
