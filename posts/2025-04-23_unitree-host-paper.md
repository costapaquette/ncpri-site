Our work on HoST control policies is now live â€” sim-to-real reinforcement learning for humanoid postural recovery. Presented at RSS 2025.
ðŸŽ‰ Breakthrough in Humanoid Robotics â€“ HoST x Unitree G1 ðŸš€
Weâ€™re thrilled to share cutting-edge research just accepted at RSS 2025 â€“
 "Learning Humanoid Standing-up Control across Diverse Postures" â€“ introducing HoST, a powerful reinforcement learning framework enabling humanoids to get up from any positionâ€¦ in any terrainâ€¦ with real-world robustness.
ðŸ¤– Why it matters for us at Itis Scientific: This validates what we've been championing â€” accessible, agile, and real-world-ready humanoid robotics. The Unitree G1, already a versatile platform, now stands tall (literally) with advanced standing-up control using:
âœ… Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning
 âœ… Robust terrain adaptation (slopes, walls, and more)
 âœ… 12kg payload resistance
 âœ… Smooth, reliable recovery from supine/prone/side

Letâ€™s build on this â€” robotics for resilience, not just novelty.
 If you're working on RL, terrain generalization, or embodied AI, letâ€™s collaborate.
