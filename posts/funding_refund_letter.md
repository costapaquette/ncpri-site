## Summary

- End compulsory union funding
- Give students a choice: Union or NCPRI

- Build an international advocacy body from the ground up

**For the students. By the students. Without compromise.**

> Every dollar given to a union that betrays its students is a dollar of lifeblood drained from the future of higher education.
> It is time to cut off the supply. It is time to build anew.
