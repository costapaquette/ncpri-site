ðŸ“œ Formal Letter â€” Demand for Funding Reallocation and Creation of a True Student Defense Fund
To Whom It May Concern,
It has become evident that the current model of student representation â€” in the form of university-affiliated unions â€” has failed catastrophically.
These so-called "student unions," funded by compulsory levies and hidden within student service fees, no longer exist to protect the rights of students.
 They exist to protect the reputation and financial interests of universities.
When students reach out in distress, these unions offer them no real advocacy, no real protection, and no real hope.
 They are lifejackets that sink the moment you put them on.
Despite receiving substantial public and student funding, these unions have shown they are little more than an insurance policy for universities, offering damage control instead of defense.
 Their silence in the face of university misconduct, their failure to act on systemic issues, and their abandonment of the very students they are paid to represent make them complicit.
ðŸ©¸ We demand a refund:
A refund on truth suppressed
A refund on transparency denied
A refund on the reparations owed for the destruction of student careers
A refund on the lives and futures lost while unions stood silent
ðŸ”¥ We demand the end of compulsory funding for broken unions.
The funding that props up these compromised organizations must be revoked.
 It must be redirected â€” to new bodies chosen directly by students, bodies that honour the trust that funding represents.
Students must be given a choice:
To allocate their fees and donations to the National Council for PhD Candidate Protection & Research Integrity (NCPRI),
Or to continue funding the exposed, compromised unions.
The NCPRI will open an independent, transparent bank account specifically for voluntary donations and student reallocated fees.
 These funds will not be used as a weapon against students, but as a true defense fund, protecting their rights, safeguarding their futures, and fighting for their interests without fear or favor.
âš¡ A movement is rising.
The National Council for PhD Candidate Protection & Research Integrity (NCPRI) stands for:
Integrity, not alliances
Action, not apologies
Truth, not theatre
Every dollar given to a union that betrays its students is a dollar of lifeblood drained from the future of higher education.
 It is time to cut off the supply.
 It is time to build anew.
Signed,
National Council for PhD Candidate Protection & Research Integrity (NCPRI)
 For the students. By the students. Without compromise.
