Title: When the Joke Isn’t Funny
In 2018, I was locked in a -40°C freezer. It wasn’t an accident. It was done as a joke, by academic colleagues — the kind of “joke” that can cost a life. I reported it.
The response?
“No record found.”
 “No witnesses confirmed.”
 “No one by that name.”
Apparently, in an institution with decades of shared memories, the name "Nigel" — a figure thousands of students knew, who managed the lab across the hallway, and whose team was present — was too vague to locate. The same Nigel who laughed with others that day. The same Nigel whose colleague stood beside him when I was pulled out, pale and shaking.
But the inquiry file calls it unsubstantiated.
 They did not ask his staff. They did not ask the obvious people who were there. They did not review the timetables or seek the laughter that echoed that day. They simply did not look.
This isn't about a man named Nigel. This is about an institution that preferred plausible deniability over due diligence.
Meanwhile, my research was sabotaged. My Azolla specimens destroyed. “Why would I do that? They had economic value,” was the only defence offered — even though the act had been confessed to me in front of another supervisor. That, too, was brushed aside.
So I became a peasant who dared enter the court of kings. A candidate not crowned, but questioned. A voice not amplified, but isolated.
And yet… I remain. Writing, documenting, remembering.
Not for revenge.
 For reform.
If you’ve ever been in the cold — literally or figuratively — and watched the doors of support quietly close around you, know this: your story matters too.
This isn’t over.
