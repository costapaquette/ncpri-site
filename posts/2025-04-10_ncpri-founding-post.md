The National Council for PhD Candidate Protection & Research Integrity (NCPRI) is committed to enhancing the postgraduate research experience through several key initiatives:​
1. Developing a Research Group Rating System: NCPRI plans to create an online database that evaluates research groups based on their supportiveness toward postgraduate students. Metrics will include funding acquisition for students, frequency of first-author publications by students, and the absence of negative feedback. To ensure authenticity, ratings will require verification via institutional email addresses and ORCID iDs, while maintaining anonymity to protect contributors.​

2. Establishing a Network of Accredited Mentors: To address challenges where supervisors may lack expertise in certain areas, NCPRI is forming a network of esteemed scholars across various disciplines. This initiative aims to provide students with access to mentorship beyond their immediate research groups, ensuring they receive comprehensive guidance throughout their academic journey. Similar models, like the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN), have demonstrated success in offering such support.

3. Advocating for Fair Authorship Practices: NCPRI recognizes concerns regarding supervisors directing research to align with their interests, potentially limiting students' academic freedom and publication opportunities. The council is dedicated to promoting fair authorship practices, ensuring that students' contributions are appropriately recognised and that research directions are determined collaboratively.​

4. Facilitating Access to Peer-Reviewed Journals: In situations where candidates face disputes or administrative challenges that restrict their access to necessary resources, NCPRI proposes establishing agreements with academic publishers or with universities. These agreements would grant affected students access to peer-reviewed journals, ensuring uninterrupted progress in their research endeavours.​
Through these initiatives, NCPRI aims to foster a transparent, supportive, and equitable environment for PhD candidates, empowering them to navigate their research careers with confidence and integrity.
