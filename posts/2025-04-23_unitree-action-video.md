First look at humanoid recovery in the wild: Unitree G1 gets up from every fall, with a HoST controller trained on reinforcement learning. Pure grit and AI.
🎥 Watch This: Real-World Recovery in Action – Unitree G1 + HoST 🤖🌍
We’ve seen humanoid research before, but not like this.
This isn't pre-programmed balance. This is learned resilience.
 With just one model, HoST enables Unitree G1 to:
✅ Stand up from supine, prone, or side postures
 ✅ Recover from disturbances (payloads, blocks, rough terrain)
 ✅ Perform under real outdoor conditions
 ✅ Transfer smoothly from simulation to real-world robotics
This changes everything for:
🦿 Fall recovery
 🦾 Field deployment
 🏗️ Real-world robotics tasks

🎯 What makes this special?
 HoST was trained using reinforcement learning with domain randomization, then deployed directly on Unitree G1. No manual fine-tuning. No fake terrain. Just smart learning and smooth execution.
📢 Let’s give credit where it’s due:
 Kudos to the researchers pushing the edge of embodied AI — and to platforms like the G1 that make real-world testing accessible.
