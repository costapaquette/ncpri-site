Satirical comic: A class on academic integrity where only one person pays attention — the PhD student. Everyone else? Already breached it.
🎭 REak News: Academic Integrity 101
🖼️ Cartoon Title: Academic Integrity
📚 Description:
 They made it compulsory — but did they really mean it?
🖋️ Panels Breakdown:
Panel 1:
 A closed classroom door bears a plaque: “Academic Integrity and Ethics – Compulsory!”
 👉 Above the plaque is a loud red sticker that reads: "MANDATORY!"
Panel 2:
 Inside, a student is sitting upright, engaged. Next to him, the professor is asleep. The dean scrolls on their phone.
 🧠 The only one learning? The student.
Panel 3:
 Outside the classroom after the lecture:
Professor: "Can I copy your notes? I wasn’t paying attention."
Student: "No, it’s unethical!"
Dean (snorting): "Who cares? Don’t be such a dweeb."
💬 Commentary:
 Sometimes the classroom teaches more than the curriculum.
 Reak News is where academic satire meets hard truths.
