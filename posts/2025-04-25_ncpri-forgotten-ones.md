NCPRI exists to remember ghosted, erased PhD candidates. We write history in public. We donâ€™t leave our own behind.
ðŸŽ“ This Is Not Abandonment. This Is Resistance.
A call for systemic reform in higher education â€“ from the desk of Costa Arvanitis
I am preparing to submit my PhD thesis â€” research years in the making, rooted in deep inquiry, innovation, and personal sacrifice. But like many who walk this path, Iâ€™ve found myself at the mercy of a system that treats independent thought as insubordination, and institutional delays as the candidateâ€™s fault.
Iâ€™ve since begun a new journey through a Master of Data Science (AI & ML), not to leave research behind, but to strengthen it. This move isn't retreat â€” it's strategy. I'm using it to advance my thesis through self-developed AI tools and statistical models, created for internal academic use.
I will finish my PhD.
 I will submit.
 I will do it with or without their infrastructure, because the award is mine â€” earned.
But this post isnâ€™t just about me.
Itâ€™s about how many candidates are quietly cut loose â€” told they no longer have library access, no longer have supervision, no longer count as scholars. This "voluntary withdrawal" fiction allows institutions to sidestep accountability while offering no viable route back in.
ðŸ“£ We need a new system â€” one that protects late-stage PhD candidates, guarantees re-entry for submission, and ensures fair supervision until the final draft is assessed.
If youâ€™ve been through this â€” or stood by someone who has â€” your voice matters here.
Join me.
 Stand for thesis rights.
 Back the credentialed, not the compliant.
