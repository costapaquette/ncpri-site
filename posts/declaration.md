ðŸš¨ A New Era for Research Integrity Has Begun ðŸš¨

Today, we launch the worldâ€™s first open, candidate-centered publishing platform.

âœ… No more gatekeeping by outdated hierarchies.
âœ… No more publishers deciding who deserves to be heard.
âœ… No more isolation for struggling candidates.

If your university fails you, NCPRI will stand beside you.

With AI-supported peer review, we verify, support, and publish what the old systems refused.

This is for the students.
By the students.
Without compromise.
