Announcing the CVEDIA-RT AI license granted for Unitree + ROS integration with edge deployment at Itis Scientific. Real-time vision and analytics on the move.
🚀 Big News for Itis Scientific & Reak Robotics
We’re proud to announce that CVEDIA has granted us a personal-use license for their cutting-edge CVEDIA-RT Studio — enabling us to integrate real-time AI analytics into our robotics ecosystem.
🎯 Why this matters: At Itis Scientific, we’re not just building robots — we’re pushing the frontier of ethical AI, public-interest vision systems, and autonomous agents that serve people, not profit.
🔍 With CVEDIA’s tech now part of our stack, we can:
Stream live analytics from our Unitree Go2 Pro
Integrate object detection + motion tracking in real-time
Run AI models securely and locally — no cloud required
And build open, transparent frameworks for institutions that need accountability in surveillance and research
🧠 This aligns perfectly with our vision:
 Robotics done right. AI done ethically.
We’re grateful to the team at @CVEDIA for supporting innovation beyond borders and bureaucracy. The future is collaborative, and it starts here.
