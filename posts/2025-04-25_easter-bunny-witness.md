I once believed in fairytales,
Like integrity, due process, too.
I thought the Easter Bunny might
Bring truth wrapped in bright foil blue.

My workplace wasn’t selling jeans,
Nor slicing steaks with sharpened knives.
This wasn’t factory or shop—
It traded souls, it altered lives.

My supervisor wore a crown,
A “professor”—he self-proclaimed,
I dared to doubt his sacred texts,
And suddenly my card was maimed.

He froze my bench, unplugged my work,
Boxed up my dreams, dissolved my name.
Yet purity ran at ninety-eight,
I published on without his claim.

Security gasped, then waved me through:
"You're still employed? How can that be?"
They thought my ghost had left for good,
But I returned defiantly.

My peers all whispered, shocked, surprised—
Yet none could speak the honest facts.
The Easter Bunny saw it all,
But rabbits don’t write witness tracts.

So here I stand, sarcastic now,
But fighting still, with words and wit.
The NCPRI’s my shield and voice—
Transparency’s our Easter gift.

Let supervisors puff and preen,
Their shadows shrink beneath the sun.
For justice, truth, and students’ rights,
We watch them closely—every one.
