The NCPRI launches a new scoring system to rank university environments based on transparency, mentoring, fair funding, and publication ethics. Itâ€™s time for performance beyond paper output.
ðŸ“Š Introducing the NCPRI Research Climate Index (RCI)
 A first-of-its-kind scorecard designed to highlight excellence in postgraduate supervision and research environments.
Rather than shame, we reward:
 âœ… Inclusive authorship
 âœ… Fair funding access
 âœ… Real mentorship
 âœ… Transparent infrastructure
Masterâ€™s and PhD voices matter. The RCI uplifts institutions that get it right â€” and inspires others to rise.
