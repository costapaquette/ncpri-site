📢 Now accepting encrypted & anonymous reports from PhD candidates worldwide.

🎓 Not a feature for coders — a safe, transparent, end-to-end encrypted space for:
• Whistleblowing  
• Misconduct reports  
• FOI delays  
• Academic injustice  

🔐 Submit confidentially:

📥 ProtonMail Encryption | PGP Secured | Candidate-first  

Or submit publicly via GitHub:  
→ https://lnkd.in/gBWu_gzW  

🧠 Encryption protects your identity, your evidence, and your story.

Let’s build the world’s first open oversight system — for candidates, by candidates.
