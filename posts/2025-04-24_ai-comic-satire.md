AI promised a witty academic comic. It delivered a blurry dorm room and a cat. A tongue-in-cheek critique of ‘AI-enhanced creativity’ gone wrong.
📉 When your AI comic generator promises “A Dean, a Student, and a Prof walk into a classroom...”
📸 What it delivers:
A blurry dorm
Two students eating pizza
A cat
🤦🏼‍♂️ “I just wanted a classroom panel… not an undergrad Netflix pilot.”
The AI comic revolution may be here... but it still can’t draw a door.
