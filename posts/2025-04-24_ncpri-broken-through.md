After years of institutional gaslighting, the movement to protect research candidates has broken through. NCPRI is here. We start with six universities and wonâ€™t stop.
ðŸš¨ WE'VE BROKEN THROUGH ðŸš¨
 The algorithm doesn't get to decide what's real.
 We do.
Today Iâ€™m proud to announce the official launch of the National Council for PhD Candidate Protection & Research Integrity (NCPRI) â€” and with it, the first wave of direct institutional outreach.
This isnâ€™t just another hashtag.
 This is the beginning of a global collaboration for real change in how we protect, support, and advocate for doctoral researchers.
ðŸŽ¯ As of today, the following universities have received our formal invitation to collaborate:
ðŸ“© RMIT University
 ðŸ“© University of South Australia
 ðŸ“© University of Newcastle
 ðŸ“© Macquarie University
 ðŸ“© University of Wollongong
 ðŸ“© Curtin University; we will contact ALL Australian universities, this is just the beginning!
These universities have been transparently CCâ€™d on the same email â€” because silence in isolation ends here. From now on, we talk together outside this bubble.
ðŸ§­ Our aim?
No PhD candidate left behind.

If youâ€™ve ever felt the walls close in during your PhDâ€¦
 If youâ€™ve ever watched misconduct go unchallengedâ€¦
 If you believe students are more than statistics â€”
Then youâ€™re already part of this.
The gatekeepers had their chance. Now itâ€™s our turn.
