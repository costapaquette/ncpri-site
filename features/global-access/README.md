# 🌎 Global Access

The NCPRI is building tools to support PhD candidates **across all time zones**, languages, and institutional systems.

## 🕒 Timezone-Sensitive Tools

We're working on interfaces that:

- Allow asynchronous review and submission
- Respect user-local time for deadlines and meetings
- Display audit timestamps clearly for transparency

## 🌐 Multilingual Submissions

Our long-term goal is to support:

- Machine-assisted translation of reports and content
- Submissions in native language with optional human verification
- Multilingual community moderators and ambassadors

## 🚧 Feature in Development

This feature is actively being scoped and tested.
