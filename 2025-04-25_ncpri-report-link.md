🚨 The NCPRI Secure Submission Portal Is LIVE!

Now accepting encrypted & anonymous reports from PhD candidates worldwide.

🎓 Not a feature for coders — a safe, transparent, end-to-end encrypted space for whistleblowing, misconduct reports, FOI delays & academic injustice.

🔐 Submit confidentially:  
→ https://lnkd.in/gkE62vdu  
📥 ProtonMail Encryption | PGP Secured | Candidate-first

Or submit publicly via GitHub:  
→ https://lnkd.in/gBWu_gzW

🧠 Encryption protects your identity, your evidence, and your story.

Let’s build the world’s first open oversight system — for candidates, by candidates.
