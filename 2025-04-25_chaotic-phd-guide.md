Surviving a Chaotic PhD: A Sarcastic How-To

Welcome to the **Chaotic PhD Survival Guide** — your ultimate handbook to enduring intellectual isolation while smiling through administrative betrayal.

☑ Be gaslit at milestone reviews.  
☑ Learn to translate “We’ll support you” as “We’ve muted you.”  
☑ File FOIs for emails you were CC’d in.  
☑ Confuse peer silence with complicity.  
☑ Expect "helpful" edits that delete 30 pages of work.

Still want to finish?  
Congrats — you’re the reason the **NCPRI** exists.

Let’s change the system so students don’t just survive. They thrive.
